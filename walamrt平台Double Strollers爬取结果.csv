As adaptable to your little one’s needs as its wild cat namesake is adaptable to its environment, the Lynx easily converts from an infant seat stroller to a bassinet stroller, or a traditional stroller seat once your sprout has outgrown its infant car seat. Each mode offers your baby a parent or world-facing view, giving you more options than traditional all-in-one baby travel systems. Both the stroller and the included Safety 1st&reg; onBoard™ LTX infant car seat feature a memory foam comfort welded seat to keep baby cozy and the anti-bacterial treatment on the faux leather handles give you added peace of mind. The Monbebe Lynx 6 in 1 Modular Travel System Stroller is JPMA certified and features a lightweight aluminum frame as well as a telescoping handle for easy and comfortable maneuverability while also folding flat with removable back wheels for compact storage. Monbebe has partnered with Watsi to help support life-changing surgeries for children around the world.</p>","<h1>Monbebe Lynx 6 in 1 Modular Travel System Stroller and Infant Car Seat, Distressed Plaid</h1>  <h3>Stroller Features</h3>  <ul>  <li>Memory foam seat with plush fabrics and detailed stitching</li>  <li>1-hand telescoping handle</li>  <li>Anti-bacterial faux leather handles and bumper bar</li>  <li>Linked brakes</li>  <li>Lockable front swivel wheels</li>  <li>Adjustable footrest</li>  <li>Oversize peek-a-boo window with mesh for added ventilation</li>  <li>Large storage basket</li>  <li>Removable bumper bar with faux leather</li>  <li>Back wheel hub cabs push in for easy removal</li>  <li>Front and rear wheel suspension</li>  <li>Decorative webbing</li>  <li>Padded harness covers</li>  <li>Padded crotch strap</li>  <li>Easy fold in any bassinet position</li>  <li>Parent cup holder</li>  <li>Stroller weighs 22 lbs.</li> </ul>  <h3>Infant Car Seat Features</h3>  <ul>  <li>Memory foam seat with plush fabrics</li>  <li>Anti-bacterial faux leather handle</li>  <li>Padded harness covers and crotch strap</li>  <li>Removable infant insert</li>  <li>Faux leather grip for parent comfort</li>  <li>Adjustable base</li>  <li>Safety 1st&reg; onBoard™ LTX infant car seat for babies 4 – 35 lbs.</li> </ul>","Features
